# Suzume
Reinventing the wheel yet another time with a custom game engine.

# Stuff we've got done so far
Suzume 0.3 has now an input handling module, and supports 
keyboard **and** mouse input.
Comes with an example in `src/test.c`!

# Updates to come
For Suzume 0.4, we’ll finally get our hands on the rendering 
pipeline!  It’ll be capable of drawing simple geometry.
